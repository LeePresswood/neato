# Run 2 – How to Continue Training

## Checkpoint Strategy
- **Automatic checkpointing** is already enabled in `run2_runner.py` via `neat.Checkpointer`. A checkpoint is saved **every 5 generations** (e.g., `neat-checkpoint-4`, `neat-checkpoint-5`).
- The checkpoint file contains the entire NEAT population, fitness scores, and the current generation number.
- To **resume** training, simply run the same command again:
  ```bash
  python main.py run2_runner
  ```
  The script will detect the latest checkpoint in the working directory and load it automatically.

## Starting the Next Run
1. **Ensure the Lua bridge is running** in Bizhawk (`neato_bridge.lua`).
2. Open a terminal in the project root (`c:/Users/leepr/Documents/Vibes/neato`).
3. Execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py run2_runner
   ```
   The script will load the most recent checkpoint and continue evolution from the last generation.

## What to Expect
- **Fitness values** will now include three components:
  1. **Distance traveled** (as before).
  2. **Velocity bonus** – rewards faster horizontal movement.
  3. **Timer bonus** – the remaining in‑game countdown timer is added, encouraging the agent to finish the level quickly.
- As generations progress you should see fitness scores rise (e.g., from ~400 to >500) and the agent will start holding the `Y` button for running and maintaining jumps.
- Checkpoint files will appear in the project root (`neat-checkpoint-<gen>`). Keep them; they allow you to pause/resume indefinitely.

## Quick Tips
- If you want to change the checkpoint interval, edit the `Checkpointer` call in `run2_runner.py` (parameter `generation_interval`).
- To experiment with different fitness weights, modify the return statement in `evaluate_genome` inside `run2_runner.py`.
- Monitor the console output; each generation prints the best genome’s fitness and saves a checkpoint.
